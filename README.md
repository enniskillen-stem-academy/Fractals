# Project: 
## Advanced Turtle Graphics - Fractal Patterns

### Description
This project is a Python-based exploration of fractal graphics using the turtle library. You will learn how to create visually appealing fractals like the Koch snowflake, with a focus on understanding recursion.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 installed (including the turtle module, which comes with Python by default).

### Setup Instructions

- Clone or Download the Repository

### Running the Code

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the folder containing the Python files.
- Run the file using the command:
    ```bash
    python3 koch_snowflake.py
    ```

## Project Contents

`basic_shapes.py`: A challenge to see how much you remember about using Turtle.

`koch_snowflake.py`: The main script that draws the Koch snowflake using recursive functions.

`koch_snowflake_solution.py`: A complete solution for drawing a full Koch snowflake with three sides.

# How to Use

## Basic Shapes: 
Start with drawing basic shapes using the turtle module to ensure familiarity.

Recursive Fractal Drawing: Use the koch_snowflake() function to understand how recursion can create intricate patterns.

Customization: Modify colors, line thickness, and recursion depth to explore the effects on the fractal design.

## Customization Ideas

### Change Colors: 
Modify the color of the fractal lines to personalize the design.

### Adjust Depth: 
Experiment with different values for depth to see how the complexity of the fractal changes.

### Create Your Own Fractals: 
Use the principles of recursion to create new fractals like the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.
